                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Nitz, a 24-year-old from Israel. I created this Chocobo-themed vacation tours site as part of my studies at John Bryce.</p>
                <p>The inspiration for this site comes from the Final Fantasy series, a renowned franchise in the world of video games. Within this series, Chocobos are iconic, bird-like creatures often used as a mode of transportation across various terrains. These friendly and versatile creatures have become a beloved symbol of the series, representing adventure and exploration.</p>

                <h2>About the Website</h2>
                <p>My website combines the whimsical theme of Chocobos with real-world vacation tours. The site features an intuitive design, allowing users to easily browse through different tour options and discover exciting destinations.</p>
                <p>The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and responsive experience. The backend is powered by Python with Flask, managing user accounts, tour details, and bookings securely through a MySQL database.</p>
